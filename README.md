Armor Stand Editor a simple to use mod, allowing you to pose/modify Armor Stand in game,
without need to use commands or external websites.
It was designed with survival usage in mind, so you can use it on your survival world/server without having
to worry about it breaking the experience.

It is compatible with Fabric and Quilt and can work purely server side, allowing vanilla
players to use all capabilities of it, while still being fully functional in singleplayer. 

## Usage
First you need to get flint (or other configured item). Then you just click with it Armor Stand 
you want to modify. Your hotbar will get replaced with setting selector (only visually, your inventory is untouched).
By using right mouse button (use/place action), you can enter/activate action bound to it (which is described
in its name). To change angle/value of movement/pose related options, sneak while having it selected and use scroll
to change value up or down.

By default, players can edit them as they want.
